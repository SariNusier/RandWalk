    <string name="guide_level1A">To choose a start - long tap on the desired area. \n \n Be prepared - even if you choose
    ideal starting point, due to waddling in pirate\'s walk you still might fall into the sea! \n \n Try walking couple of times.\n If you are really unlucky, you will be able to change your starting point.</string>

        The parrot\’s feather coloration
        pattern doesn\’t look like a
        perfect copy of its parents\’ one, with whom it shares the genetic heritage. Genetic
        differences occur due to a rearrangement of DNA during the reproduction (“crossover”) and
        unpredictable mutations.\n \n
        In general, patterns of pigmentation in multicoloured animals is not controlled only by their set of genes
        (“genotype”) but also the history and the environment contribute to their variability. \n
        Even if we could select the same genes, follow the same history, expose cells to the same
    environment, still organisms would display some difference in their observable features ("phenotype").
    \n \n Scientists have recently thought that randomness in the process of gene expression can be a
     major source of phenotype variability. It means that, if molecules of a specific type exist in few copies inside a cell,
     random effects stemming from their random walks can become important. \n \n What does it imply at the end of the day? Every
     individual in a population of living organisms is unique and differs from anyone else, even its twin or clone,
     in appearance and behaviour. \n \n Biologists refer to variation in measured levels of gene
    expression products(e.g. proteins) as "noise", regardless of the source. They call "extrinsic"
     the noise due to microscopic cell-to-cell differences of environment and history, "intrinsic" the
    one due to random fluctuations."</string>
