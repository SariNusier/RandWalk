    <string name="intro_level1A">The pirate just arrived in a new harbour and is ready to go out, but he is aware that he might be tottering on his way back to the ship. \n \nTry helping him with choosing bar wisely to maximise his chances of arriving to the ship! \n \nChoose a starting point of the pirate\'s walk and observe his movement… \n \nBe prepared - even if you choose
    ideal starting point, due to waddling in pirate\'s walk you still might fall into the sea! \n \nTry walking couple of times.\nIf you are really unlucky, you will be able to change your starting point.</string>
    <string name="intro_level1B">\n\n\n\nThis time, pirate is not moving alone, he has your help! You will be able to help by tilting the phone and thus forcing his direction towards the boat. \n\n\n\nHowever, he\'s very strong and the movement has a great deal of randomness still. Try couple of times - until you arrive home and understand how the walk is modified by your help - the drift.</string>

        Pirate’s walk:\n A mathematician would describe the pirate\'s movement as a “random walk” - because all the steps the pirate takes have different lengths and seem to be in arbitrary direction. These processes, which include series of chance moves, are widespread in both daily life and scientific research: follow the link to see some examples: http://goo.gl/6ljFpC .
\n\nParrot\’s feather:\n Scientists have recently thought that randomness in the process of gene expression can be a major source of phenotype variability. It means that every individual in a population of living organisms is unique and differs from anyone else, even its twin or clone, in appearance and behaviour. Follow the link to learn about this phenomenon http://goo.gl/eLEFNc .

    <string name="level2A_text">        You are about to enter one of the parrot\'s feather cell, where you will explore why each of these animals appear so colourful and diverse!\n\nNow instead following a pirate, follow the movements of big molecules - transcription factors inside the cell. As the transcription factors take part in the process called “gene expression” and play important role enabling the creation of mRNAs - try to create as much as possible of them!\n\nTo read further about DNA, mRNA and transcription factors and how they interact in gene expression networks select “Learn more” in the side menu or visit http://randomwalkspp.wix.com/pirateparrot</string>
    <string name="level2B_text">You have just seen how random walks at the cell level contribute to differences in gene expression. Adding up all these microscopic events, through a chain of connected biochemical processes, may give rise macroscopically to variability among parrots, e.g. in colouration patterns.\n\nFrom 1 cell to 2, from 2 to 4 … to millions. Cells grow and replicate by splitting into cell daughters. Sometimes it happens in biology, especially during the development of a newly born organism! You will see that a random partitioning of molecules follows the randomness in their walk</string>
    <string name="level2C_text">Now gene expression in two cells evolves independently! Observe how different mRNAs lead to different colours. Is the number of TFs the same in the two cells? Do they move in the same way? Do they reach the promoter region at the same time? Some randomness can be seen in these slight differences and slight differences emerge also out of this randomness.</string>
    <string name= "level2a_endText">Transcription factors are constantly colliding with organelles and other smaller molecules which constrain their random walk. There is a variable chance for them to reach the promoter region on the DNA and for mRNAs to be created: the number of mRNAs is linked to phenotype changes.\n\nDid you manage to create some mRNAs? Go to level B or, if you are not satisfied, start the process again… Randomness  will help you produce a different number of mRNAs and change colours in the parrot\'s feather!</string>
